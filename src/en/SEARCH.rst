|Search| Search
---------------------------

The search dock window contains several tabs with similar functionality
that allows to search for objects by name, ident or other criteria.

Filters are defined by various controls which are mostly self
explaining. Only text filters and the tri-state checkboxes like
``Lighted``, ``Approach`` or ``Closed`` need a few extra remarks below.

All filters can be used together where all conditions have to be met
(``and`` operator). All filters except the distance search filter are
applied immediately. The distance search is applied after a short delay
for each change.

A tooltip on the blue help button on the top right shows information
about searching.

See :ref:`ui-tables` for more information how to rearrange columns in tables.

.. tip::

  You can use the cursor key ``Down`` to jump from the input fields into the result table.

  Using keyboard shortcuts like ``Ctrl+I`` for ``Show Information`` or ``Ctrl+M`` for ``Show on map``
  are usable directly from the input fields and will apply to the topmost airport in the result table.

  The same applies to other tabs like navaid and logbook search as well.


.. _text-filters:

Text filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard is to look for partial text matches. This means that a search
term of ``Chicago`` will find the airports Gary Chicago as well as O'Hare (due to city Chicago).

``EDDE`` will find the airports Erfurt-Weimar (EDDE) as well as Wedderburn.

Use stars ``*`` as wildcards matching any text and double quotes ``"`` for exact word match.
Using ``"EDDE"`` will find the the airport Erfurt-Weimar (EDDE) only.

The search is negated (i.e. find all entries that do **not** match) if the first
character of a search term is a ``-``.

Note that all of the above does not apply to numeric fields like
``Runways: Min`` or ``Altitude: Max``.

.. _text-filters-ident:

Airport and Navaid Ident Text filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The airport search has a special search field for all airport idents and names
(ICAO, FAA, IATA, local, name, city, state/province and country) using
partial match for quick search.

Separate search fields are available in the drop down menu under ``Names``. The same rules as
mentioned in :ref:`text-filters` above apply.

Entering three or four characters in the ``ICAO Code`` field of the
airport search tab will trigger a quick search which ignores all other
filters.

The fields ``Ident, name, city, state, province, country or area code`` for the airport and
navaid ``Ident`` search allow more functionality besides the
one described above:

- Put an search term in double quotes ``"`` to force an exact search, i.e. avoid partial matches.
  Example: ``SEA`` finds two airports one being ``SEAM`` while ``"SEA"`` finds only ``KSEA`` because
  of the matching IATA code SEA.
- Separate several idents by space to do a search for each ident. ``EDDF EDDM`` find the two airports Frankfurt and Munich, for example.

Tri state checkboxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are used to filter airports by presence of certain facilities or
properties.

Below are the states as they are shown in Windows 10:

-  **Black Box:** Condition is ignored.
-  **Checked:** Condition must match.
-  **Empty Box:** Condition must not match.

Colors and look of these checkboxes vary with theme and operation
system. So instead of gray another color might be used (red fill on
Linux or a ``-`` for macOS).

.. _menu-button-search:

|Menu Button| Menu Button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Airport, navaid, userpoint and online search tabs contain multiple sections
of search filters. These sections can be switched on and off with the drop
down menu on the menu button |Menu Button| on the top right.

The drop down menu prefixes menu items with a change indicator to
show that the related filter section has modifications.
The menu item suffix ``(changed)`` shows an option is modified and
visible to the user. ``(changed, not used)`` indicates a modified option which is not used since the
related fields are hidden from the dropdown menu button.

.. tip::

  If you do not get the expected results or no results at all use the
  :ref:`reset-search` menu item, the button ``Reset Search`` |Reset Search| or press ``Ctrl+R`` to
  clear all search criteria.


.. figure:: ../images/searchmenu.jpg

  Click the dropdown menu. This will indicate if there are changes in the related section.
  Facilities are all the airport properties like add-on, tower and so on in this example.
  *Little Navmap* ignores sections in the search which are not visible (deselected in the drop down menu).
  (1) has changes in a visible section (``Lighted``) and (2) has changes in a hidden section (``Runway``)
  which are ignored.

.. _distance-search:

Distance search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is only available in the airport and navaid search.

This function allows you to combine all other search options with a
simple spatial search.

The checkbox ``Distance`` has to be selected to enable this search. The
result will include only airports or navaids that are within the given
minimum and maximum range of NM from the search center. This
allows you to quickly search for a destination that is within the range
of your aircraft and fulfills other criteria like having lighted runways
and fuel.

The center for the distance search is highlighted by a |Distance Search
Symbol| symbol.

To restrict the search further you can select a direction (North, East,
South and West).

Check the drop down menu for the suffix ``(changed)`` and the search
fields for any remaining text if the distance search does not give any
or unexpected results. Use the
:ref:`reset-search` menu item, the button ``Reset Search`` |Reset Search| or press ``Ctrl+R`` to
clear all search criteria.

.. figure:: ../images/complexsearch.jpg
  :scale: 50%

  A complex distance search: Find all airports within
  a distance between 200 and 400 NM from Frankfurt (EDDF).
  Airports should have a rating greater than 0 and should have at least
  one lighted runway. Military and closed airports are excluded. The
  resulting airports are highlighted on the map by selecting them in the
  search result table. *Click image to enlarge.*


.. figure:: ../images/complexsearch2.jpg
  :scale: 50%

  A complex search for scenery: This example shows how
  to find specific add-on scenery by using the ``Scenery Path`` search
  field. This shows all airports of the Orbx New Zealand South Island
  add-on scenery that have lighted runways. *Click image to enlarge.*

.. _random-flight:

Random Flight in Airport Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selects a flight using a random departure and a random destination based on the current airport search result.

See :doc:`RANDOM` for more information about this function.

.. _airport-search-ident:

Ident and Names in Airport Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input field ``Ident, name, city, state, province, country or area code`` in the airport search tab searches for all available airport identifiers and names.

- ``Ident``: Mostly equal to ICAO code but can be different especially for small airfields. X-Plane
  uses partially an unofficial code in this field like ``XPA000B``. Available for all simulators and
  Navigraph navdata.
- ``ICAO``: Four letter `ICAO code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_airport_code>`__. Only
  available in X-Plane.
- ``FAA``: Airport code used in the United States given by the `Federal Aviation Administration <https://www.faa.gov/>`__.
  The FAA code is only available in X-Plane.
- ``IATA``: Three letter `IATA airport code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code>`__.
  Available in X-Plane and Navigraph navdata.
- ``Local Code``: Official local airport code mostly used for small airfields. Only available in
  X-Plane.
- ``Name``, ``City``, ``State/Province``, ``Country/Area Code``: Airport names and administrative names.
  Note that not all names are available depending on simulator.

The airport codes and names are also shown in the information windows, tooltips and in the map
labels as well as in :doc:`ROUTEDESCR`. ICAO, FAA, IATA, and local codes are shown and the internal
ident is avoided if possible.

**Example:**

``Akutan`` is shown as ``Akutan (PAUT)`` with its official ICAO code ``PAUT`` instead of the
internal X-Plane code ``XPA000B``.

.. tip::

  Hide the additional airport codes if you do not use X-Plane or if you are not interested in
  these columns. You can do this by moving the columns to the rightmost position or by shrinking them
  to minimum size. See :ref:`table-view`.

.. _airport-search-admin:

Country, State/Province and City in Airport Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that quality and availability for administrative data depends on the selected simulator.

X-Plane airports are community work and therefore administrative names have varying quality, if set at all. Country names are often used in several not official variants like ``USA``, ``U.S.A.``, ``United States`` and more.

.. note::
  MSFS 2020 provides names in the local language as selected in the options dialog on page :ref:`user-interface`
  but country names are not available.

  MSFS 2024 does not provide administrative names except the airport name.

.. _airport-search-override:

Override in Airport Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entering an airport ident using three letters or more ignores all other search options and shows only airports matching this ident.

This is indicated by the message ``Ident overriding other search options.`` in the search window footer.

.. _table-view:

Search Result Table View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All selected elements in the table view will be highlighted on the map
using a black/yellow circle. See
:ref:`highlights-legend` in the map legend for more information.

Use ``Shift+Click`` or ``Ctrl+Click`` to select two or more elements
(multi-selection).

See :ref:`ui-tables` for more information how to rearrange columns in tables.

.. figure:: ../images/airportsearchtable.jpg

  Airport search result table. All additional search
  options are hidden by using the drop down menu of the menu button on the
  top right.

.. figure:: ../images/navaidsearchtable.jpg

  Navaid search limited to ICAO region ``LI`` (Italy)
  and VOR, VORTAC and TACAN stations that have a range of 100 or more NM.

Footer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The footer shows the number of selected, loaded and visible entries considering search and filter criteria.

Note that you to select :ref:`show-all` from the table context menu or have to scroll down to see all entries:

.. _mouse-clicks-0:

Mouse Clicks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A double-click on an entry in the table view shows either an airport
diagram or zooms to the navaid or other feature. Additionally, details
are shown in the ``Information`` dock window. Single click selects an
object and highlights it on the map using a black/yellow circle.

Top Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~

Available buttons and menu items depend on search tab. This chapter explains common buttons and menu items.

.. _reset-search-button:

|Reset Search| Reset Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as :ref:`reset-search` in the context menu.

.. _clear-selection-button:

|Clear Selection| Clear Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as :ref:`clear-selection` in the context menu.

|Help| Help
^^^^^^^^^^^

Display a quick help in the tooltip. Click to open this chapter of the
manual in the default browser.

.. _menu:

|Menu Button| Menu Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drop down menu button that allows to hide or show search options.

See :ref:`menu-button-search` for details.

The drop down menu suffixes menu items with an indicator ``(changed)`` to
show that the related filter section has modifications. You can use this to
find out why a search does not give the expected results.

.. _search-result-table-view-context-menu:

Context Menu Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Available menu items depend on search tab.

Many menu items are mirrored from the :ref:`map-context-menu` and provide the same functionality
for the selected item below the cursor or the selected rows in the result tables.
These are omitted here.

.. _show-on-map-search:

|Show on Map| Show on Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show either the airport diagram or zooms to the navaid, userpoint or
other features on the map. The
zoom distance can be changed in the dialog the options dialog on the page
:ref:`options-map-navigation`.

.. _mark-airport-addon-search:

|Mark Airport as addon| Mark Airport as Add-on
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Marks an airport with a yellow circle as add-on.
Same as :ref:`mark-airport-addon-map`. Enabled for all airports at the clicked position.

.. _filter-by-entries-including-excluding:

|Filter by Entries including| |Filter by Entries excluding| Filter by Entries including/excluding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

reasons. This menu item allows to load and show the whole search result.
The view switches back to the limited number of entries after a search
filter is modified or the sort order is changed. The number of all,
visible and selected entries is shown at the bottom of the tab.

Be aware that showing all navaids and airports can take some time
especially if they are highlighted on the map when selecting all entries
in the search result. The program does not crash but needs a few seconds
to highlight all the objects on the map.

.. _follow-selection:

Follow Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The map view will be centered, but not zoomed in, on the selected feature
if this function is enabled.

.. _copy:
