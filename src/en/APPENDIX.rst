Tips for slow Computers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Dialog ``Options`` -> ``Map`` -> ``Details while scrolling ...``: Use ``Normal ...``
- Dialog ``Options`` -> ``Simulator Aircraft`` -> ``Simulator Aircraft scroll box size ...``: Use a higher value to reduce map updates.
- Close the window ``Flight Plan Elevation Profile``. It will stop all background processing when closed.
- Avoid airspaces. Switch them off using the |Show Airspaces| button on the airspaces toolbar.
- Switch off all AI traffic in the dialog ``Connect``. See :ref:`options`.
- Use the map projection ``Mercator``. It consumes less resources since it can use the downloaded image tiles as is and does not transform
  them to the spherical format.
