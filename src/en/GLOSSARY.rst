Glossary
--------

3D
    X-Plane airport which contains at least one 3D object. May be a fully
    constructed major airport.

Add-on airport
    FSX/P3D: All scenery data that is found outside of the base flight
    simulator ``Scenery`` directory is considered an add-on.

    X-Plane: All airports in the ``Custom Scenery`` directory are considered
    add-on airports and will be highlighted accordingly.

Approach Procedure
    An approach procedure is a series of maneuvers for the transfer of an
    aircraft in instrument flight conditions from the initial approach to a
    landing or to a point from which a landing may be made visually. If a
    flight plan includes a standard arrival procedure (STAR), an approach
    procedure will normally follow the STAR.

Arrival Procedure
    Approach, transition or STAR procedure.

BGL
    A binary file with the extension BGL which is part of a flight
    simulator scenery containing airport, navaid or airway information.
    These files can also contain traffic, landclass, elevation or other
    information which is not relevant for *Little Navmap*.

CSV
    Comma-separated values text file.

DAT
    A text file format used by X-Plane to store airport, navaid and
    procedure information.

Departure Procedure
    SID (standard instrument departure) procedure.

DME
    Distance measuring equipment or a radio navaid.

Empty airport
    An airport that has no taxiways, no parking positions or gates, no
    aprons and is not an add-on airport and is not a water airport.

FACF
    Final approach course fix. A point aligned on the final approach course
    of an instrument procedure.

FAF
    Final approach fix. The point where the final approach segment begins on
    the instrument approach.

Fix
    This term refers to a waypoint, radio navaid or an calculated point on a
    procedure.

Flight Plan Position
    An user-defined waypoint which is part of the flight plan.

FLP
    Flight plan format used by the X-Plane FMS, Aerosoft Airbus and other
    add-on aircraft.

FMS
    X-Plane flight plan format.

FS9
    Flight Simulator 2004.

FSX
    Flight Simulator X or Flight Simulator - Steam Edition.

ft
    Feet. 0.3048 meter.

GIS
    A geographical information system like Google Earth for example.

ILS
    Instrument landing system.

Initial Fix
    This is the first fix of a procedure.

MAP
    Missed approach point. The point on the final approach which represents
    the termination of the final approach and the start of the missed
    approach.

MSFS
    Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

Navaid
    VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB or waypoint/intersection.

NDB
    Non directional beacon - radio navaid.

NM
    Nautical miles. 1.852 km.

P3D
    Prepar3D v2 to v5.

Parking
    GA ramp, cargo ramp, fuel box or gate at an airport.

PLN
    FSX and P3D flight plan format. Can save all information in flight plans
    using annotations.

POI
    Point of interest. An userpoint type.

Procedure
    A STAR, SID or approach and the respective transitions.

Radio navaid
    VOR, VORTAC, TACAN or NDB.

Rating
    Airport zero to five star rating depending on facilities.

Rhumb Line
    When using a magnetic compass or direction indicator it is more
    convenient to fly a constant track direction. This can be achieved by
    following a rhumb line track, rather than a great circle track. Note
    that the rhumb line connecting two points on earth is longer than the
    great circle path. Also, near the poles and for longer distances the
    rhumb line is not usable.

Scenery Library Database
    This is an internal database (`SQLite <http://sqlite.org>`__) that is
    created by *Little Navmap* when reading all the flight simulator BGL or
    DAT files. It allows fast complex searches and map display.

SID
    A standard instrument departure is an air traffic control departure
    procedure that helps to simplify clearance delivery procedures. A SID
    will keep aircraft away from terrain but it is optimized for air traffic
    control route of flight and does not necessarily provide the best climb
    gradient. It provides a balance between terrain and obstacle avoidance,
    noise abatement and airspace management.

SimConnect
    A programming interface that allows applications to read and write
    flight simulator parameters.

STAR
    A standard terminal arrival is a flight route that usually covers the
    phase of a flight between the last point of the route filled in the
    flight plan and the first point of the approach to the airport, normally
    the initial approach fix (IAF). A STAR connects the en-route phase with
    the approach phase of the flight.

Start position
    Used for departure in flight plans. Either runway, helipad, GA ramp,
    cargo ramp, fuel box or gate.

TACAN
    Tactical air navigation system - radio navaid used by military aircraft.

TOC
    Top of climb.

TOD
    Top of descent.

VOR
    VHF omni directional radio range - radio navaid.

VORDME
    VHF omni directional radio range with distance measuring equipment-
    radio navaid.

VORTAC
    Co-located VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon and tactical air
    navigation system (TACAN) beacon.

Userpoint
    An user-defined waypoint like a bookmark, point of interest or visual
    reporting point (VRP).

UTC
    Universal coordinated time. Also: Greenwich time or zulu time.

VRP
    Visual reporting point for VFR flights. An userpoint type.

Waypoint
    Navaid defined by coordinates.
