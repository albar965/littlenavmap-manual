Glossary
--------

3D
  X-Plane airport which contains at least one 3D object. May be a fully
  constructed major airport.

Airport
  Means all airports, water airports, airstrips or heliports.

Add-on airport
  FSX/P3D: All scenery data that is found outside of the base flight
  simulator ``Scenery`` directory is considered an add-on.

  X-Plane: All airports in the ``Custom Scenery`` directory are considered
  add-on airports and will be highlighted accordingly.

  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020: All airports located in the ``Community``
  directory and the ``Official\OneStore`` or ``Official\Steam`` are considered to be add-on airports.
  Exceptions are ``fs-base``, ``fs-base-genericairports`` and ``fs-base-nav``.

  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: This information is not provided by MSFS 2024.

Approach Procedure
  An approach procedure is a series of maneuvers for the transfer of an
  aircraft in instrument flight conditions from the initial approach to a
  landing or to a point from which a landing may be made visually. If a
  flight plan includes a standard arrival procedure (STAR), an approach
  procedure will normally follow the STAR.

Arrival Procedure
  Approach, transition or STAR procedure.

BGL
  A binary file with the extension BGL which is part of a flight
  simulator scenery containing airport, navaid or airway information.
  These files can also contain traffic, landclass, elevation or other
  information which is not relevant for *Little Navmap*.

Checkbox
  A user interface element that allows to toggle a setting between two states (on and off)
  or three states (on, off and not applicable).

CSV
  Comma-separated values text file.

DAT
  A text file format used by X-Plane to store airport, navaid and
  procedure information.

Departure Procedure
  SID (standard instrument departure) procedure.

Dialog
  A dialog window requiring user input. Most dialogs block the whole application until closed.

DME
  Distance measuring equipment or a radio navaid.

Empty airport
  An airport that has no taxiways, no parking positions or gates, no
  aprons and is not an add-on airport and is not a water airport.

FACF
  Final approach course fix. A point aligned on the final approach course
  of an instrument procedure.

FAF
  Final approach fix. The point where the final approach segment begins on
  the instrument approach.

Fix
  This term refers to a waypoint, radio navaid or an calculated point on a
  procedure. A fix might be defined by VOR radial and distance, for example.

Flight Plan Position
  A user defined waypoint which is part of the flight plan.

FLP
  Flight plan format used by the X-Plane FMS, Aerosoft Airbus and other
  add-on aircraft.

FMS
  Flight plan format used by X-Plane 11 and 12. Can be loaded into the stock GPS, FMS or add-ons.

FS9
  Flight Simulator 2004.

FSX
  Flight Simulator X or Flight Simulator - Steam Edition.

ft
  Feet. 0.3048 meter.

GIS
  A geographical information system like Google Earth for example.

LDA
  Localizer type directional aid. A type of localizer-based instrument approach to an airport.

IGS
  Instrument guidance system – a modified ILS to accommodate a non-straight approach.

ILS
  Instrument landing system.

IPv4
  Internet Protocol version 4. Slowly replaced by IPv6. Often used in parallel with IPv6.
  IP addresses look like ``192.168.1.1``.

IPv6
  Internet Protocol version 6 replacing IPv4.
  IP addresses look like ``fe80::c0b9:1832:abc5:d5a1``.

Initial Fix
  This is the first fix of a procedure.

Intersection
  In aviation, an intersection is a virtual navigational fix that helps aircraft maintain their flight plan.
  This manual also uses the synonym waypoint.

Logbook Entry
  Created by the user or automatically on finishing a flight containing takeoff and landing.

LNMPLN
  Own flight plan format of *Little Navmap*.

MAP
  Missed approach point. The point on the final approach which represents
  the termination of the final approach and the start of the missed
  approach.

MSFS
  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 or 2024.

Navaid
  VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB or waypoint/intersection. Also ILS and Localizer.

NDB
  Non directional beacon - radio navaid.

NM
  Nautical miles. 1.852 km, 1' (one minute or 1/60°) latitude or 1' longitude at the Equator.

P3D
  Prepar3D v3 to v5.

Parking
  GA ramp, cargo ramp, fuel box or gate at an airport.

PLN
  FSX and P3D flight plan format.

POI
  Point of interest. A userpoint type.

Procedure
  A STAR, SID or approach and the respective transitions.

Radio navaid
  VOR, VORTAC, TACAN or NDB.

Rating
  Airport zero to five star rating depending on facilities.

Scenery Library Database
  This is an internal database (`SQLite <http://sqlite.org>`__) that is
  created by *Little Navmap* when reading all the flight simulator BGL or
  DAT files. It allows fast complex searches and map display.

SDF
  Simplified directional facility is a localizer-based instrument non-precision approach to an
  airport, which provides a final approach course similar to ILS and LDA approaches, but not as
  precise.

SID
  A standard instrument departure is an air traffic control departure
  procedure that helps to simplify clearance delivery procedures. A SID
  will keep aircraft away from terrain but it is optimized for air traffic
  control route of flight and does not necessarily provide the best climb
  gradient. It provides a balance between terrain and obstacle avoidance,
  noise abatement and airspace management.

SimConnect
  A programming interface that allows applications to read and write
  flight simulator parameters from FSX, P3D and MSFS simulators.
  It is also used to read airports and navaids from MSFS 2024.

STAR
  A standard terminal arrival is a flight route that usually covers the
  phase of a flight between the last point of the route filled in the
  flight plan and the first point of the approach to the airport, normally
  the initial approach fix (IAF). A STAR connects the en-route phase with
  the approach phase of the flight.

Start position
  Used for departure in flight plans. Either runway, helipad, GA ramp,
  cargo ramp, fuel box or gate.

TACAN
  Tactical air navigation system - radio navaid used by military aircraft.

TOC
  Top of climb.

TOD
  Top of descent.

VOR
  VHF omni directional radio range - radio navaid.

VORDME
  VHF omni directional radio range with distance measuring equipment - radio navaid.

VORTAC
  Co-located VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon and tactical air
  navigation system (TACAN) beacon.

Userpoint
  A user defined waypoint like a bookmark, point of interest or visual reporting point (VRP).

User Feature
  Any display object like traffic patterns or measurement lines which can be added or removed by the user.

UTC
  Universal time coordinated. Also Zulu time.

VRP
  Visual reporting point for VFR flights. A userpoint type.

Waypoint
  It is a navaid defined by coordinates. Synonym for intersection in this manual.
