Random Flight Generation
-------------------------------------

This function is a part of the airport search tab and can be started from the menu item ``Flight Plan`` -> :ref:`generate-random-flight`.
See :doc:`SEARCH` for more information about the airport search.

This allows to select a random departure and destination based on the current airport search result and
the departure and destination airport in the flight plan.

A progress dialog allowing to cancel the selection is shown if the process takes longer.
Once done the user can accept the departure/destination pair or start a new calculation.

Adjust the airport search to get appropriate airports for your random flight.
You can select a minimum runway length or procedures required, for example.

A dialog window is shown where you can select either a fixed departure or a fixed destination
airport for the random flight generation. Add at least one airport to your flight plan to enable this
function.

The random flight generation puts the change on the undo/redo stack once you accept a
generated flight. This is the same behavior as used in the flight plan route description which
allows to restore a previous flight plan and its changes by clicking the item :ref:`undo-redo` in the menu ``Flight Plan``.

Note that the maximum distance for random flight plan is 10.800 NM.

You can refine the flight plan further by running the :doc:`ROUTECALC` to get airways or intermediate navaids,
selecting procedures (:doc:`SEARCHPROCS`) or :doc:`PARKINGPOSITION`.

.. note::

  The random flight generation does not work with a distance filtered airport list (:ref:`distance-search`).

  The distance filter is not needed for random flight generation from an airport.
  Add the airport in the center of the distance search point to the flight plan
  so that the plan consists of only of this airport.
  Then adjust the maximum distance of the random search. Select
  ``Use current flight plan`s departure airport as fixed departure airport ...`` in the next dialog window.
  This will give you a random destination from your current airport in the flight plan.
