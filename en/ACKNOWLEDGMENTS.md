## Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments}

A big thank-you for all people supporting me, sending me their log files, screen shots, ideas for improvements, friendly messages, donations and more.

A huge Thank you! to Paul Watts for his support, for testing, tips, links to incredible tools and for all his work on the manual.

Plenty of thanks to [Hervé Sors](http://www.aero.sors.fr) for allowing me to include his updated `magdecl.bgl` file with _Little Navmap_.

A very special thank-you to Roberto S. from Switzerland for his valuable input and also helping with his capability to find the most obscure bugs.

Thanks to Navigraph for kindly allowing me to include a free AIRAC cycle in the download. Thanks for Richard Stefan for his great support.
Current AIRAC cycles can be purchased from [Navigraph](http://www.navigraph.com).

A big Thank you! to Jean Luc from [Reality XP](http://www.reality-xp.com) for his great support.

Thanks to Jose from [fsAerodata](https://www.fsaerodata.com/) for his kind support.

The French translation of the program was done by Patrick JUNG alias Patbest. Thank you!

Dankeschön! for the German translation to merspieler and Stephan Leukert.

Thanks to Ricardo Vitor for the translation to Brazilian Portuguese.

Thanks to Daniel "Wolf" \([wolfinformatica.com](http://wolfinformatica.com)\) for the Spanish translation.

Thank you! to Eddy Crequie for doing the Dutch translation.

Thanks to all beta testers for their effort, patience and ideas: Barry, Jean-Pierre, Brian, Gérard, John, Remi, Paolo, Sam and many others.

Another big Danke! to Marc from Germany for all his great ideas and endless bug reports.

Thanks to all in the forums who patiently supported me and gave invaluable feedback during the public beta:

[AVSIM](https://www.avsim.com), [SimOuthouse](http://www.sim-outhouse.com), [FlightX.net](https://flightx.net) and [FSDeveloper.com](https://www.fsdeveloper.com).

This project and my library [atools](https://github.com/albar965/atools) would not exist without the fabulous documentation of the BGL files in the [FSDeveloper Wiki](https://www.fsdeveloper.com/wiki). So, here a huge thank-you to all the contributors.

Also a thank you to Ed Williams for his Aviation Formulary.

Without the open source [Marble](https://marble.kde.org) widget that allows me to access and display all the maps I would still be busy doing that myself for years.

No [Qt application framework](https://www.qt.io) and I could not even draw a simple button.

Let's not forget about all the services that provide us all the online maps for free:

[Stamen Design](http://maps.stamen.com), [OpenTopoMap](https://www.opentopomap.org) and [CARTO](https://carto.com/).

A thank-you to the [GIScience / Geoinformatics Research Group](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/index_en.html) of Heidelberg University for kindly giving me permission to use their map [OpenMapSurfer](http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de).

And last but not least: If there were no [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and its thousands of contributors none of us would have any maps at all.
