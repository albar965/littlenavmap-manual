## Dock Windows

The user interface of _Little Navmap_ consists of a main window and several dock windows which can be detached from the main window or arranged within the main window.

The docked windows can be moved around in their docked position and can be detached from the main window by simply dragging them outside of the main window (click the title bar to drag), by double-clicking their title bar or by clicking on the window symbol on the top right.

Double click on the docked window's title bar or click on the window symbol again to move the windows back into their docked position.

All docked windows, except the map window, can be closed if they are not needed. You can also drop docked windows on each other to create a tabbed view. The tabs will appear at the bottom of the dock stack in this case.

Note that dock windows open automatically when selecting functions like `Show Information` or clicking on the user aircraft, for example.

Hold `Ctrl` while clicking on the window title bar to prevent a window from going back into the docked state in the main window and keep it floating.

Toolbars are also movable by clicking on the left handle and can also be closed or detached from the main window similar to the dock windows. Toolbars can also be opened and closed in the main menu `Window`.
